# Driver Test Realm

DriverTestRealm is an integration testing framework that runs drivers in a
hermetic environment. It is useful for driver authors to test their drivers,
and for system developers to run integration tests that use specific driver
stacks. DriverTestRealm provides a hermetic version of all of the Driver
Frameworks APIs, and provides an environment that is nearly identical to a
running system.
